# DevInsights

DevInsights is my personal blog where I share articles about programming, coding tips, and upcoming components, such as error corrections and more. The blog is built using React, Styled Components, React Icons, React-router-dom, and 18next for project internationalization. All articles and the blog itself are available in both English and Portuguese.
